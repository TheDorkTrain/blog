# Bryce's BlogBlog

## Description

This blog helps me organize my thoughts and movie reviews for the day.
It was a great way to explore local memory storage methods and practice dynamic sections.

## Usage

Blog creates inputs on its first page with various fields for leaving names and titles

On the second page it displays the posts with a handy dark theme that is easy on the eyes for reading the posts
